# VLSI-Calculator-Project
This project involves the design and simulation of a VLSI-based calculator that performs addition and subtraction of 4-bit numbers using SRAM memory. The project was designed using **Cadence** tools and includes detailed simulations for all components, such as the SRAM cells, decoders, adders, and subtractors.
